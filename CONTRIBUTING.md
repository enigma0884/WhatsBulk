# Contributing

Thanks for showing your interest in this project! Before you make any contributions, a few things are required.

- Code must match the existing code style. Make sure to run `npm run lint` as this will help you check!

- Feel free to create issues to discuss changes/additions you wish to make before working on them.

- Make sure there are no active pull requests that have already implemented the changes/additions you wish to add.

- Pull requests should point to the development branch (`dev`) and not the master (`master`) branch.
