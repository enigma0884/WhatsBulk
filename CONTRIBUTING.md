Thanks for showing your interest in this project! Before you make any contributions, ensure that:

- The code matches the existing code style. Running `npm run lint` will help you check!

- You create issues to discuss changes/additions before working on them.

- There are no active pull requests that have already implemented the changes/additions you wish to add.

- Pull requests point to the development branch (`dev`) and not the master (`master`) branch.
